         * other activity is already open. In the latter case the NotificationActivity will just be
         * closed. The system will restore the previous activity. However, if the application has been
         * closed during upload and you click the notification, a NotificationActivity will
         * be launched as a root activity. It will create and start the main activity and
         * terminate itself.
         *
         * This method may be used to restore the target activity in case the application
         * was closed or is open. It may also be used to recreate an activity history using
         * startActivities(...).
